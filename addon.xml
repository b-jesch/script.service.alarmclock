    <summary lang="en">Provides an alarm clock for XBMC.</summary>
    <description lang="en">The add-on provides five individual alarms for
    XBMC playing either a file or an URL on repeat.

    Features
     - Up to five individual alarms
     - Scheduling for a week day, every day or Monday to Friday
     - Plays either a file or a custom path may be set which may point to any
       media type supported by XBMC including for example web radio URLs
     - Tries to activate the configured HDMI device over CEC

    Notes
     - If the duration is over, XBMC will stop playing regardless of what is 
       being played at the moment. This means a) alarm 1 could disable 
       alarm 2 if alarm 2 starts before alarm 1 start time plus duration 1 
       is over and b) it may stop something you were playing intentionally
       in the meantime.
     - The overflow over to the next day is not considered. You should make 
       sure the start time of any alarm plus its duration is before 0:00.
