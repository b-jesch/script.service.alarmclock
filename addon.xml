    <summary lang="en">Provides an alarm clock for Kodi.</summary>
    <description lang="en">The add-on provides five individual alarms for Kodi playing either a file or an URL (for example Webradio)
on repeat. Notes: If the duration is over, XBMC will stop playing regardless of what is being played at the moment. This
means a) alarm 1 could disable alarm 2 if alarm 2 starts before alarm 1 start time plus duration 1 is over and b) it may stop
something you were playing intentionally in the meantime. The overflow over to the next day is not considered. Credits:
